"""
    function build(modeltype::Type{MyFibonacciSequenceModel}, data::NamedTuple) -> MyFibonacciSequenceModel

The `build` function is a factory method that creates a new instance of the `MyFibonacciSequenceModel` type. 
The function takes two arguments: `modeltype` and `data`. 
    
### Arguments
- `modeltype::Type{MyFibonacciSequenceModel}`: The type of the model to be created.
- `data::NamedTuple`: A NamedTuple containing the data required to build the model.

The `data::NamedTuple` must contain the following fields:
- `n::Int64`: The number of elements in the Fibonacci sequence. 

### Returns
- `model::MyFibonacciSequenceModel`: A new (empty) instance of the `MyFibonacciSequenceModel` type.

To populate the model with the Fibonacci sequence, pass the model instance to the `fibonacci!` function, along with a Iteration model instance.
